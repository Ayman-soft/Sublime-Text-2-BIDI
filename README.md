Bidirectional text support for Sublime Text 2
===================

Currently Sublime Text 2 is not supporting bidirectional languages like Arabic, Hebrew etc.. Using this plugin you can view bidirectional texts. This plugin uses Pythons BiDi implimentation found at https://github.com/MeirKriheli/python-bidi.

Please note, I don't know Arabic or Hebrew. I have checked the results by pattern matching. Its a starting point.
